Did you know that Buddhism has a flag? I certainly didn't! What does it look like and what does it mean? Read on!

<!--more-->

The flag was designed in the late 19th Century to symbolize and universally represent Buddhism. Like most flags, there is a lot of symbolism to it.

* The Blue represents loving kindness, peace, and universal compassion.
* The yellow represents the middle path; that is avoiding extremes and emptiness.
* The red represents the blessings of practice-achievement, wisdom, virtue, fortune, and dignity.
* The white represents the purity of Dharma-leading to liberation, outside space or time.
* The orange represents the Buddha's teachings-wisdom.
* These 5 colors represent the six colors that emanated from Buddha when he attained Enlightenment.

Its a cool flag, and thought it was interesting to share.
