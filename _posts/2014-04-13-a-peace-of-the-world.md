So in my usual internet browsing, I discovered something cool.  Its called "A Peace of the World!"  According to its creator, [Taylor Powell](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/649883031/a-peace-of-the-world/creator_bio)

> A Peace of the World is a visually stunning, multi-city video experiment to see what the effect of meditation has on masses of people.</blockquote>

It started with a video called "A Peace of NYC."  Talyor asked 10 people to meditate for 30 minutes in public in New York City, and filmed them doing so.  The results are in the video below:

According to Taylor:

> The exposure of someone stopping their day and resigning 30 minutes to quiet and still peace affected each participant, the throngs of people around them, and me. The participants found a startling quiet on some of the loudest environments.

Now he wants to expand it to the world, and has started a Kickstarter to help fund it.  This expanded video will be called "A Peace of the World."  A video explaining it is below.

This looks like a cool project, and look forward to seeing the results!

Happy Meditating!
