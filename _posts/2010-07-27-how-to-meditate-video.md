First, you get into a comfortable [position](/posts/about-meditation/meditation-postures), close your eyes, relax your body, and focus on the inhalation and exhalation of your [breath](/posts/about-meditation/meditation-techniques/focusing-on-the-breath). If you get distracted by thoughts, return your focus to the breath. Eventually your thoughts will slow down, and your mind will relax.

That's it. You now know how to meditate. I wasn't kidding when I said it was easy to learn. I will tell you, however, if you are just starting out, that it will be tough in the beginning for your thoughts to calm down, but give it time and it will happen. It will seem boring at first, but in time it will become more enjoyable :)

Feel free to comment, and Happy meditating!
