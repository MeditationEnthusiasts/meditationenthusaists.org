Long-time viewers of Meditation Enthusiasts may remember many years ago, there was a spin-off site of Meditation Enthusiasts called Spiritual Blogs.  Spiritual Blogs was a site where members of the Meditation Enthusiast community were able to submit their website about Meditation, Yoga, or Buddhism, and their website would be added to an online directory of similar sites.  Each site got their own page, which showed the latest posts, social media links, and site information.  Meanwhile, all the submitted site's RSS feeds were merged into a single RSS feed.  Every new post was tweeted out on the official Spiritual Blogs Twitter.  Spiritual Blogs was, in the end, retired when we changed domains.

Now, after a few weeks in the making, we are excited to announce its successor: [Meditation Enthusiasts Sites](https://sites.meditationenthusiasts.org/).  Meditation Enthusiasts Sites allows owners of websites about Meditation, Yoga, Buddhism, etc. to submit their website.  If the website is accepted, a page containing information about their site will be added, which will include a description of the site, the site logo, links to social media, a comments section, and the most recent posts from an RSS feed.  Their site's RSS or ATOM feed will also be merged with the global RSS feed, which is mirrored on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/meditationsites) and [https://www.reddit.com/r/MeditationSites/](Sub-Reddit).

If you own a site about Meditation, Yoga, Buddhism, or something similar and wish to submit, [here's how](https://sites.meditationenthusiasts.org/submit/).  If you want to see what your site's page would look like, take a peek at [ours](https://sites.meditationenthusiasts.org/profile/meditationenthusiasts/).

The way our site is generated is completely Open Source; you can view the source code and contribute to it here: [https://github.com/MeditationEnthusiasts/sites/](https://github.com/MeditationEnthusiasts/sites/).

We're excited to finally have a maintainable way to carry on Spiritual Blog's legacy.  I hope everyone learns something new from the new site!  Know someone with a cool meditation site?  Don't forget to show them!

Happy Meditating!
