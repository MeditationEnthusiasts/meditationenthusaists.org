So in my usual internet browsing, I discovered this simple video on YouTube. The synopsis is a young man learns meditation from the great resource that is the internet, and decides to try it. Watch the video below:

Video was created by YouTube user [Cecam Taller](https://www.youtube.com/user/canalcecam)

So why did I post this video?  The video was a good representation on how I discovered meditation.  I did a bunch of research online, and I decided to just sit down and try it.  As the young man in the video discovered, it is awesome!  I was hooked ever since!

So how did you discover meditation, what was your first experience like?  Comments are always welcome!

Happy Meditating!
