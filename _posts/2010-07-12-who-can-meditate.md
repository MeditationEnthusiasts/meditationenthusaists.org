When some asks you "Who can meditate?" what do you think of? If you never meditated before, you would think buddhists, people who practice yoga, and people who practice martial arts. You would usually never answer "you" or "me".

We all can meditate!

<!--more-->

It does not matter what religion, background, age, or personality. Anyone can learn and practice meditation. One of the common meditation techniques is observing your body breathing. We all breath all the time! So observing your breath is something anyone can do! Including YOU!

You can be Buddhist, Catholic, Jewish, or Atheist. You can be a child, a teenager, an adult, or a senior. Anyone can experience meditation.

So in short: Who can meditate? YOU CAN! Not sure how? No problem! Check out the [Meditation Techniques](/category/about-meditation/meditation-techniques) articles for more information on how to. Its easy, and can be enjoyable. Trust me.

Happy Meditating!
