This is a tough question. Meditation is different for everyone. According to dictionary.com meditating is:

> * _Buddhism & Hinduism_ To train, calm, or empty the mind, often by achieving an altered state, as by focusing on a single object.
> * To engage in devotional contemplation, especially prayer.
> * To think or reflect, especially in a calm and deliberate manner.

These are not bad definitions of meditation. Generally, when people meditate they focus on a single object (usually breath or mantra) until the object is the only thing they focus on, and the mind relaxes. Meditation can be used in a prayer-like fashion, and it can be away to reflect on your life.

But this definition, like most dictionary definitions, is dry. It makes meditation seem boring. So I will say what meditation is to me:

Meditation to me is a way to escape the world for a short period of time. It brings your mind into the present moment.  You do not worry about the future or the past while meditating, you are only in the moment.  It is a time to relax your body and mind, and a time to try to understand more about yourself. It is a way to become a more calm, peaceful, and loving person. It can bring people, friends, and family together.

Meditation does mean a lot to me. I can tell it changed me as a person. I find myself more calm and more focused than I was before I started meditating.

So what does meditation mean to you? Feel free to leave a comment.

Happy Meditating!
