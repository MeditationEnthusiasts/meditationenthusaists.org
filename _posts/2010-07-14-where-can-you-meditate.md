If you see meditation in popular culture (movies, books, etc.), you may think that you need to meditate in seclusion, in a cave, in a temple, etc. Although you can meditate in these places, you do not have to.

You can meditate anywhere that you are comfortable meditating. You can meditate in your house, outside, and many other places. The point is your surroundings should be comfortable for you.

Some people are comfortable meditating out in the open and in public. Others are not. Some people like to meditate outside, while others like to be inside only. Where ever you choose to meditate, just be sure that you are in an environment that you can relax in.

If you need to de-stress during the day, but you can't figure out a good spot to meditate, here are a few ideas:

<!--more-->

In your office while on break, in school during a break, in a car (not while you are driving), on a train, in a plane, any where where you can close your eyes for a few minutes, and focus on your breath or mantra. Remember, you can meditate in any [position](/posts/about-meditation/meditation-postures) that is comfortable, you do not have to sit cross-legged!

So if you want to meditate, do not let location stop you (assuming its safe, and legal). As long as you are comfortable meditating there, you can meditate at that location. You can even have other people join you!

So remember, you can meditate anywhere, at anytime, with anyone.

Where have you meditated before? Any interesting locations? Comments are welcome.

Happy Meditating!
