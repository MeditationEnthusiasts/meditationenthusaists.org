You might be asking, "Why should I meditate?"

Allow me to answer that question with another question: "Why not?"

No seriously? Why not? Meditation can really only help you, there's not many, if any, negative side-effects. If it can only help you, why not do it?

Meditation can lower stress, blood pressure, increase the quality of life, along with several other benefits. And it only takes a few minutes of your time a day!

So why do I meditate? It is an answer that is hard to put into words, but I will try. It allows me to escape the crazy stressful world for a little while, calms me down, and gives me an additional energy boost to get through the day. Also, I enjoy doing it, that's reason enough.

Meditation has also made me more calm, friendly, and overall nicer to people.

So what are you waiting for? There is nothing holding you back from meditation except for YOU!

So why do you meditate? Comments are always welcome :)

Happy Meditating!
