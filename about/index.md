Welcome to Meditation Enthusiasts!

I started meditating when I was in middle school.  I helped me deal with stress, anxiety, and made me a more friendly person.  I wanted to document my experience and what I learned while practicing meditation in case others wanted to learn as well.

So, in 2010, I created this site 2010 to document my meditation journey, and what I've learned.  I'm not a meditation teacher, or a guru, or any of those things, just an average person giving is take on the practice of meditation.

I hope you enjoy browsing this site, and I also hope you learn something.

Happy Meditating!

-Seth
