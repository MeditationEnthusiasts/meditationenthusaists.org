As I stated in my last post, I do not believe it is possible to levitate while meditating.  However, for those who still believe, these are a series of techniques I found throughout the years that claim they can get you airborne.  I decided to post those here just in case people were wondering what I tried all those years ago to get in the air.  If you decide to try these for yourself, and start levitating, I will feel incredibly silly.

Some of these techniques I read online over 10 years ago.  I am mainly going from memory.  Some of the techniques may not be exact, but the basic idea is there.

### Hole on Mars

This technique claimed that there was some strange gravity hole on mars that if you focused on, it would pull you up and cause you to levitate while meditating.

* Sit cross-legged in a meditation [position](/posts/about-meditation/meditation-tips/meditation-postures/).
* Close your eyes.
* In your minds eye visualize the room around you.  This is your "perspective".
* Have your perspective rise through the ceiling, such that you are now picturing being above the roof of your building.  Keeping having your perspective rise all the way up through the sky, and into space.
* Eventually, you'll go so high you'll reach Mars.  There you will see a hole.  Feel this hole start to pull you up towards it.  Eventually, you will start to feel a force pulling you upwards.  You will feel lighter until you levitate.

So... if there was a mysterious gravity hole on Mars, and you focused on it while a straight line between you and Mars is THROUGH the Earth... do you get heavier?  Does this technique only work when Mars is directly above you? If its off at an angle, do you float sideways?  There are so many questions!  And yes, I did do this technique.  I swear, I felt lighter, and I felt a pulling sensation, but I stayed grounded.

### Think Happy Thoughts
So this technique is as simple as it sounds.  Think happy thoughts.  The rationale behind it was... interesting.  When you have a young kid, and they are mad or sad, and you try to pick them up, they feel really heavy.  All of their negative emotions is (literally) weighing them down.  However, when a young kid is happy and you pick them up, they feel lighter.  So, if you thought happy thoughts, you would eventually become so light, that you would float.

So I believed this one for a few reasons.  I have younger cousins, and if you tried to pick them up while they were sad, they did feel heavier than when they were happy.  Though, the reason for this was when they were happy, they probably wanted to be picked up, verses being sad and being dead weight.  The second reason was because of Yogic Flying (which i will cover later).  The yogic flyers always seemed so happy while they hopped around.  Maybe there was something to this technique?

While doing this technique, I thought about Christmas, birthdays, puppies, love, and every other happy thought an 8th grader could think of.  I felt a lot lighter, but I still remained on the ground.

### Udana

So... I read this EXACT technique on two different websites.  Which means, one site blatantly stole the technique from the other.  The two sites were [wingmakers.co.nz](https://web.archive.org/web/20030815080429/http://home.xtra.co.nz:80/hosts/Wingmakers/Levitation.html) (which is long gone, you need to visit their site via the Wayback machine), and a Russian site called [rin.ru](https://web.archive.org/web/20040120005347/http://istina.rin.ru/cgi-bin/eng/print.pl?sait=2&amp;id=512) (link via the Wayback machine, since the site seems a tad sketchy).

For those who are aware of the chakras, this technique is supposed to use them to allow one to levitate.  Chakras, for those who don't know, are essentially energy centers throughout the body.  One is at the base of the spine, another is near the genitals, another a few inches above the belly button, one in the center of the chest, one in the throat, one in between the center of the forehead, and the last one is at the top of the head in the center.  These websites asserted that meditating on one of three chakras (base of spine, heart, forehead) would grant the ability to levitate.  The sites do not say how one "meditates on a chakra", however.

The sites then talk about the "udana".  The udana links the throat, forehead, and top-of-head chakras together.  The sites say the udana "is very important in that it helps the chakras to exist, integrate, and stay connected. The udana is responsible for swallowing, putting a person to sleep, and controlling hunger." Sounds not totally crazy right? Well, apparently "it is also responsible for levitation, moistening the body, and helping the immune system, and is also responsible for dimensional travel like teleportation and walking through walls, rock, and other obstacles, etc."  Uhh, what?

Anyways, the technique:

* Close your eyes an visualize a cord (the udana) from the base of the throat going through the center of your body to the top of your head.  It should be golden and white-blue in color.
* Maintain the visualization and breathe energy into it every time you breath.  You should see the udana become "more visible in form and color" and "become more real and vivid along with every breath".
* (Side note, the site talks about something called "internal vision"-which is apparently better than x-ray vision (?)-here for some reason).
* When you "get the hang of" the visualization, visualize the udana grow larger and larger until "you feel that it is big enough to carry you upwards and rise".  Note, they don't say how it grows larger... does it get taller?  How about wider?  Does it get bigger in one direction, or all around?

Yeah this technique is off-the-rails crazy.  And yet I tried it!  Even though in the very same paragraph it talks about LITERALLY WALKING THROUGH WALLS.   Apparently having a "light" body allows one to do that.  Needless to say, I did not gain the ability to walk-through-walls... or levitate for that matter.  Younger me was gullible...

### Phantom Sun

Wingmakers had another technique on their site.  This time involved visualizing a sun.

 * Sit cross-legged, have your tongue touch the roof of your mouth, breath through the nose always.
 * Close the eyes if desired.
 * Visualize a sun the size of a basketball 4-8 feet above your head.  It should radiate golden energy in all directions, just like the real sun.
 * Visualize this phantom sun shoot a "laser like fluid radian energy" into your head.  The energy goes down through your throat and into your "soul seat" area; which is between the throat chakra and the heart chakra.
* When you inhale, you will "collect" the energy being shot from the phantom sun in this "soul seat" area.
* You can visualize the collected energy as another, but smaller, phantom sun.  It should also radiate energy in all directions.
* When you exhale, make the small sun in the "soul seat" rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise.
* Continue to visualize collecting energy while inhaling, and the "soul seat" rotating while exhaling.  Eventually, your body will become lighter and lighter and will "float automatically".

No, this one didn't work either.  Although, at least it didn't talk about walking through walls.

### Conclusion

So, I did try all of these techniques.  None of them worked.  You would think younger me would realize that these techniques wouldn't work when the sites I read them on talked about teleportation, invisibility, and portholes (portals to another dimension).  But, I *really* wanted to levitate, so I tried these techniques, no matter how ridiculous they seemed, because maybe, just maybe, it was crazy enough to work.

Don't make the same mistake I did.  You're only wasting your time.

Happy Meditating!
