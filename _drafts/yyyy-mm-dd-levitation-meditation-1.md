As I mentioned in [previous posts](/posts/about-meditation/meditation-techniques/motionless-meditation/), I used to be an active member of the PsiPog.net community.  This was a community dedicated to psychic abilities (e.g. telekinesis, remote viewing, astral projection, etc).  One of the reasons why I started meditating was because of this website.  It was suggested that to develop these abilities, meditation was important!  One of the things I wanted to do was to levitate while meditating, you know, like monks do in the movies (I was in like 7th grade, give me a break).  I researched all kinds of techniques to levitate while meditating, all on websites of varying sketchiness.

I tried all of the techniques I read online.  ALL OF THEM.  I *felt* lighter while performing these techniques.  Surely there was something to this?  "I just had to practice more", I thought to myself.  There was all of these people claimed they could online, and that their techniques worked.  After all, who would go on the Internet to tell lies?

Luckily, as I grew older and learned more about how the world works, I came to the conclusion:

**It is not possible to levitate while meditating<**

And even if it was, is it worth it?

I'm mainly writing this series of posts so if there are any other people out there trying to figure out if it is possible to levitate while meditating, they don't fall for the same traps I did, and they don't waste their time trying to chase a goal that simply isn't possible.

That being said, I don't regret trying to levitate.  I can't deny, it did get me interested in meditation, which lead to the creation of the very website you are reading this post on.  It also taught me to be skeptical about what I read on the Internet.  When I realized that some of the techniques I tried didn't work, I began to question things I read online (an important lesson in this day-and-age).

If you are trying to levitate while meditating, ask yourself, why are you trying to do it?  I started to realize that even if levitation was possible while meditating, did it matter?  Did levitating make me more "enlightened" than other people?  Or was it a big distraction to make a cool parlor trick?  The entire levitation thing was probably nothing more than my ego trying to be better than the "unenlightened plebs who were forever grounded".  Once I stopped trying to levitate, I noticed that my meditations were much better, and less frustrating since I wasn't trying to achieve an impossible goal.

I split this topic into separate parts so each post isn't too long.  I have a lot to say on this topic:

* My Experience
* Some Techniques
* The Physics
* Don't believe everything you see
* Telekinesis is not possible
* What about Yogic Flying?

Happy Meditating (on the ground)!
