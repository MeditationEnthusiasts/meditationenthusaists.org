Whether we want to admit it or not, there are people out there who want to trick you.  Sometimes, its for fun, and no one gets hurt.  Magicians are an example of this.  Heck, we _pay_ them to trick us for entertainment because, sometimes, it is fun to be tricked.  Unfortunately, there are people out there who want to trick you for less-fun reasons.  They want your money, they want your political support, or they just love making people's lives miserable.

As I mentioned in my first post in this series, one of the lessons I learned while trying to levitate was to be more skeptical about what I read online.  This post will highlight some of the ways I was tricked into believing levitating while meditating was real.

### A Big Stick

We'll start with something a little fun.  There is a trick where someone would be levitating several feet in the air, and the only thing between them and the ground was a giant stick.  I remember reading online that the stick "kept you grounded" or something silly like that.  I thought "incredible, these guys are floating in mid air!"  Oh boy, was middle-school me wrong.

This is actually a simple trick.  The stick that is used to "keep them grounded" was actually connected to a heavy platform, that was usually hidden by some kind of rug.  The stick would extend up through the floating person's clothes, and would actually be connected to a platform that the person would sit or stand on.  Its not magic, but some clever mechanical engineering.  See an example of this trick in the video below.

I bring up the big stick since after I learned that it was all a trick, well, it was the start of me becoming skeptical of the paranormal things I read online. When I read articles about levitation and saw photos, I wondered, "is this real?"  Eventually, I stopped believing in levitation while meditating all together (among other things I won't get into here).

### Misleading photos

I've seen a lot of misleading photos when it comes to levitation online.  Now, you may be thinking to yourself "Photoshop".  The truth is, the photo can be 100% genuine but still be misleading.  Take the "Yogic Flying Example" picture below.

* Photo from [http://www.amazingabilities.com/amaze9a.html](http://www.amazingabilities.com/amaze9a.html)

This photo is (probably) genuine, but it is misleading.  It looks like the three people in the photo are levitating.  I'll explain more about Yogic Flying in a future post. Essentially it isn't so much "Yogic Flying" so much as "Yogic Hopping."  During Yogic Flying, people hop in the air, and immediately come back down.  This photo was snapped mid-hop, giving the illusion that the three people are levitating.

Camera angles can also mislead you.  A photographer named [Michael Paul Smith](https://www.flickr.com/photos/24796741@N05/) takes photos of miniature cars and buildings, but angles it so they seem life-size.  Here's an example of this, via his Flickr:

<a title="Twin Coach Delivery Truck - Setup Shot" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/24796741@N05/36359026724/in/photostream/" data-flickr-embed="true"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4363/36359026724_63400ff318.jpg" alt="Twin Coach Delivery Truck - Setup Shot" width="500" height="183" /></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Some levitation photos are nothing more than clever angles.  For example, one can lay down on their back on the floor, lift their legs so they are at a ninety-degree angle, and cross them.  They can then stand some kind of pillow or cushion a foot "under" them.  The last step is to snap a photo either overhead, or from the side and rotate it.  BOOM! You have a fake levitation photo.

Then, of course, there is [Photoshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoshop).  Photoshop, for those who are unaware, is software that allows one to manipulate photos.  This includes combining two different images into one.  When I was a member of PsiPog.net, there was the "knife" image, which I archived.

[![Knife](/static/img/m_ni-knife.jpg)](/static/img/m_ni-knife.jpg)

There was debate on whether or not the photo was genuine or not.  According to the site

> This is the most controversial image in the psionic community. I have seen pages and pages of posts detailing how real or fake this image is - it's unbelievable.  Analysis of the shadow position, "blurred" spots, specks in the "wrong" spot, questions regarding the environment, and looking at the specific bytes in the file itself. At first it was annoying, but now it's actually cool that this simple image has caused so much discussion.  Who would have thought?

Faking a levitation photo isn't difficult to do in theory.  You'll need to take two photos, a "base" photo, and then the object you want to levitate.   The base photo will be the open hand, and another will be the knife.  In Photoshop, you make the knife a "layer" and place it on top of the base photo.  The tough part is to make it convincing.  You need to add shadows, and maybe blur the edges.  The angles and lighting need to make sense as well.  Some people are REALLY good at Photoshop, to the point where you can't tell the photo was faked or not.

It is also possible that the knife photo didn't have the knife inserted, but had something removed.  For example, maybe there was a string holding the knife up in the original photo.  Photoshop is able to delete the string, and fill in the spaces with a pattern that looks like the background.  Again, this is easier said then done; at least if you want to make it convincing.

Here's two tutorials from petapixel on how to make fake levitation photos for those who want to try it (but promise you won't sell it off as the real thing please?).

### Misleading Videos

Videos are not immune from being misleading.  Like with photos, camera angles, lighting, or clever editing can give the illusion of levitation.  A simple of this example is in the below video from YouTube user FilipTheGreat:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jQmrmq_YyV4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

In this video, they used Adobe After Effects (they admit it in the title and the description).  If you look closely under the meditator in the video, you'll see a blurry box, which was probably a green box he was sitting on that was edited out.  This isn't the best edit, but there are better, more convincing videos out there.

Videos, like photos, don't need any fancy software to be misleading, however.  A lot goes on behind the camera, or in places you can't see.  For example, does a door open by itself?  There's probably something pushing it open hidden between the door and the camera.  An object moving by itself could be a fan behind the camera, or a magnet under the table.

Even the angle of the video can mislead.  There's a magic trick called the "Balducci" levitation technique.  The idea is you lift one foot up off the ground, and stand on the tippy-toe of the other foot.  Given the right angle and some distance, it looks like you are floating in midair!  But, if the angle changes, the illusion falls apart. Below is an example of this technique from YouTube user Grace Baptist Church:
