In this post, we're going to go through what it would require in order for a person to levitate themselves half a meter (just a little over a foot-and-a-half) in the air.

### Gravity

First, we should talk a little about gravity; it is the thing that keeps us grounded after all.  Gravity is a force that exists in our universe where two different objects are attracted to each other, regardless of distance apart from each other.  ANY object that has mass has gravity.  Yes, that includes you.  You are currently "producing" a force of gravity to every single object in the universe right now while every single object that has mass in the universe is exerting a force of gravity on you.  That includes the computer you are reading this on right now, to the furthest star in the galaxy.

If you want to calculate the force of gravity between two objects, you would use this formula:

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>g</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>G</mi><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mfrac></math>

where G is the universal gravity constant, m1 is the mass of the first object, m2 is the mass of the second object, and r is the distance between the two objects.  G's value is

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>6</mn><mo>.</mo><mn>67</mn><mo>&#160;</mo><mo>*</mo><mo>&#8201;</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>11</mn><mo>&#160;</mo></mrow></msup><mfrac><mrow><mi>N</mi><msup><mi>m</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mrow><mi>k</mi><msup><mi>g</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac></math>

For G's units, m is meters, kg is kilograms, and N is Newtons.

The reason why marbles aren't orbiting around you right now is G is a _really_ small number.  You need a lot of mass to produce enough gravity to make a difference.  Say you have a 5 kg (about 11 lb) bowling ball.  The average person weighs [62 kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body_weight#Average_weight_around_the_world) (about 136 lb). That person is one meter apart from the ball.  Plugging those numbers into the formula above, that person and the ball are exerting 0.0000000414 Netwons of force on each other.  That is practically zero.

The Sun is considerably bigger than the Earth in terms of size and mass.  The reason why we are not being pulled off the Earth and into the Sun is the force of gravity weakens the farther you are away from the object.  The Sun is massive.  Its, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_mass), 2*10^30 kg.  Meanwhile, the Earth is, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit), 149,597,870,700 meters (93 million miles) from the Sun.  If we use the formula above, the force between the Sun and the average human (62kg) is, assuming my math is right, about 0.37 Newtons.  That's about 37 grams on Earth.

The reason why we stay on the Earth and don't float around is because we are so close to it, and the Earth has a lot of mass.  Because of the force of gravity on Earth, objects in the air fall towards the Earth at an acceleration of 9.81 m/s^2.

### Mass vs. Weight

One important aside here...

Mass is different than weight.  Mass is how much matter an object is made up of, while weight is the force of gravity acting on a mass.  Think of a bathroom scale, it probably has a spring inside it that, when compressed, will calculate how much weight is on it.  When you bring this scale to the Moon however, the springs won't compress as much, as gravity is lower on the Moon.  A bathroom scale, therefore, doesn't measure mass, it measures the force of gravity acting on a mass; or weight.

Another way you can find the mass of an object is with a [balance scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_scale#Balance_scales).  This is where you put an object of unknown mass on one side, and put objects of known mass on the other side.  When the scales are balanced, add up the mass of the known objects, and you found the mass of the unknown object.  A balance isn't calibrated to Earth's gravity, so if you brought it to the Moon, you'll notice an object on the Earth has the same mass as an object on the Moon.

The whole purpose of this aside is this:  You have a mass.  So long as you have a mass, gravity will act on you.  You could weigh 1 gram, but gravity will still pull you down.  The only way to escape the force of gravity completely is to have zero mass.  However, if you have zero mass, you will probably die.

Since you probably are not going to eliminate your mass while meditating without producing ill effects on you, the only way to levitate while meditating is to produce a force to overcome the force of gravity.

### Beating Gravity

You can overcome gravity right now!  Stand up from the chair you are probably sitting on right now and jump in the air.  When you jump in the air, you jump with enough force to overcome the force of gravity.  But, the force of gravity doesn't stop acting on you.  The nanosecond you leave the ground, gravity starts to pull you back down.  Since no other force is pulling you up while you are jumping, and gravity is continuously pulling you down, you will eventually stop ascending, and start to fall.

So, to levitate, its not enough to simply overcome gravity, you need to overcome gravity AND CONTINUE TO DO SO.  We can use the following formula to figure out how much force gravity exerts on a person:

F = m*a

where m is the mass of an object (in our case, a 62 kg person), and a is an acceleration (the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s^2).  In order to cancel out gravity, we need to produce an upward force of 608.22 Newtons.  To overcome gravity, we need to make a force greater than this value, and have it  propel us up.  When we reach our desired height, we then need to produce this exact force, otherwise we will fall, or eventually hit our head on the ceiling.

### Conclusion

The entire point of all of that scientific mambo-jumbo is this. According to physics, it is possible to levitate yourself **if** you are able to produce enough force to overcome gravity (608N for the average person to be exact).  Honestly, compared to teleportation, telepathy, astral projection, invisibility, and whatever other paranormal stuff is out there, the concept of levitation actually fits with physics.

The physics of levitation is the easy part.  We're able to levitate objects with magnets or with giant fans.  Magnets produce a magnetic force to overcome the force of gravity, while giant fans blow air that lifts the object.  The hard part to levitate while meditating is producing enough force out of... something... to act on your body in order to lift you in the air.

608 Newtons doesn't seem like a lot.  In fact, according to (you guessed it) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(force)), its less than the human bite strength of 720 N.  Well, try levitating an apple (about 1 Newton) with your mind, and see how easy that is.  Levitating yourself is about 600 times harder.

So that is what it will take to levitate your body in the air.  You, while meditating, need to somehow produce a force that overcomes the force of gravity.  I personally don't believe it is possible to produce a force like this.  But, we'll talk more about that in a future post.

Happy Meditating!
